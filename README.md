🛫 Flight Reservation System in Java 🌍

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about crafting elegant solutions, and here's a glimpse into one of my projects – a Flight Reservation System built in Java. ✈️📝

This repository houses a comprehensive Flight Reservation System that allows you to manage flights, passengers, and bookings. It's designed to streamline the process of booking and canceling flight tickets. The system features:

📅 **Flight Management:** An intuitive class structure for representing flights with detailed information such as flight numbers, departure/arrival times, destinations, and prices.

👤 **Passenger Information:** A dedicated class for storing passenger details, including full name, passport number, age, and nationality.

📝 **Data Persistence:** The system efficiently reads and writes flight and passenger data to external files (`FLIGHTS.TXT` and `PASSENGERS.TXT`) using Java's file handling capabilities.

⚙️ **User Interaction:** An interactive command-line interface where users can view available flights, book tickets, and cancel reservations.

🌟 **Key Features:**

🔍 View Available Flights: See a list of flights along with their details, including departure/arrival times and prices.

✈️ Book a Ticket: Easily book a ticket by selecting a flight and providing passenger information.

❌ Cancel a Ticket: Effortlessly cancel a ticket using the passenger's passport number.

📝 **Code Highlights:**

- **Object-Oriented Design:** The system employs object-oriented principles, encapsulating flight and passenger information within well-defined classes.
- **File Handling:** Utilizes file reading and writing techniques for persistent data storage and retrieval.
- **Date-Time Formatting:** Demonstrates usage of Java's DateTimeFormatter for formatting date and time data.
- **User Interaction:** Engages users through a simple yet effective command-line interface, guiding them through various operations.

Feel free to explore the codebase, learn from the implementation, and contribute to this project's growth. I'm open to collaboration and eager to enhance this system further. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding and safe travels! 🚀🌎
